# TegSQL
The name TegridySQL (short for TegSQL) is inspired by the Tegridy Farm in South Park and tries to correct some of the wrong SQL implementations, such as null support, implicit conversion support, etc.

## Rules

1. Make it simple.
1. At the beginning, various mature packages can be used to improve the efficiency of the implementation.
1. Later on there will be as few dependencies as possible.
1. Use the standard library if you can.
